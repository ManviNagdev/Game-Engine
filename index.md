## Game Engine Development in C++

In this project, I built a game engine in C++ from scratch. It allows multiple players to play the game synchronously and works well for 2D platformers. It follows object-oriented design and makes extensive use of inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. Other key concepts that were used are from client-server communication, logical time, multithreading, physics, and socket programmning.

### Libraries Used
1. SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library): For providing simple application programming interface to various multimedia components. [Download](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
2. ZeroMQ: For communicating between client and server through message passing. [Download](https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq)
3. MessagePack: It is an efficient binary serialization format which lets one exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. [Download](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/tree/cpp_master)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ManviNagdev/Game-Engine/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
